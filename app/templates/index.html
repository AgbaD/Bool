       <p>
            Nobody knows your account better than you. Thatâ€™s why 
            you should never share your account details and token 
            with anyone over the phone, SMS or email.

       <h4>Security Tips</h4>
       <ul>
            <li>
                    Giving away your Internet Banking login, PIN and codes 
                    from your token device, gives anyone total access to your 
                    account. Bool will never ask for any of these details via 
                    any form of communication
            </li>
            <li>
                    Create strong passwords for your Online Account login 
                    details. Change them often.

                    Subscribe to SMS alerts to be delivered to your cell phone
